So these are the albums that I listened to the most this past September, in no particular order.

Some are new releases, some are new discoveries and some are re-discoveries!

* Klô Pelgag - Notre-Dame-des-Sept-Douleurs

Really interesting art pop in french! Nice instrumentation, diverse palette of sounds.

* Infinity Frequencies - Between Two Worlds

This is music for staring blankly through the window. Hypnagogia, music for the quarantined, or by the quarantined?

* death's dynamic shroud - DERELICT MEGATOWER I

Well I had a couple of vaporwave days, and death's dynamic shroud had to appear. Almost all the discography is up on Spotify, amazing!

* Kelly Lee Owens - Inner Song

Really nice house infused pop, great production. Sometimes it sounded to me like a Beach House meets Deep House, not a bad combo!

* Vulkan - Mask of Air  

Well crafted songs, quality production. I would like to say refreshing progressive metal, but I'll say solid. Their new 2020 release is really good as well, surprised that I hadn't discovered this band in my prog metal phase.

* Aminé - Limbo 

Fun album, this is the rap album you can recommend to your parents. Aminé knows how to craft interesting and accessible hip-hop.

* Cryptic Shift - Visitations from Enceladus 

Intrincate and brutal, a really nice balance between the two. Really looking forward for more from this band.

* Anthony Naples - Fog FM 

Great production, quality deep house tunes.

* Yukika - Soul Lady 

This album man, so fun and colorful. Mixing classic city-pop vibes with the pristine and bright k-pop production. This is a must if you want to get into quality korean music, which exists in great quantities!.

* Pleasure Model - Kendo Dynamics

This belongs to the great deep house albums catalog.

* Primitive Man - Immersion

Skull crushing music from one of the best Death Doom / Sludge Metal bands today. Another great album, more dissonnance than in previous releases.

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png">](https://open.spotify.com/album/1z6E3dJeKCMLe5VeXHFzjM?si=kKSJOlzrTlOSxJRpeJCLtw)

* Brian Eno - Another Green World (2004 remaster)

I mean, this is a classic. I can't begin to comprehend why while listening to the Eno catalog last year, I didn't realize the work of art that this album was. I have listened to this sound exhibition countless times for the last days. Mr. Eno demonstrates that he is an artist in all the sense of the word. Each sound in this album is in the perfect place. Fripp's snake guitar is sublime, you can visualize the textures and sounds in this LP. These albums make you love music.

* Fleet Foxes - Shore

New release from one of my favourite bands, and new direction! At least a great change in production which sounds preety good. Not too adventurous like Crack Up but great nonetheless.

* Osees - Protean Threat

Well I like Thee Oh Sees more, but whatever, they are still the same awesome band. Great release, not a single bad track.
