What a year! This post is a (belated) wrap-up of the albums I enjoyed the most during 2020. 

2020 was a slow when it came to discovering new music. Towards the end of the year I couldn't find much time to explore new albums.

Nevertheless, here's a list of those which I really liked, in no particular order.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/wrapup2020-noname.png" width="830" height="800">

* **Nero di Marte - Inmoto** - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/6GBhTtkSM0VFVl1vZBdjf4?si=ZvKoAsY4RhOAUgS8EdHrCg)

Nice prog/post metal infusion, they achieve a really tense atmospheres. Came to know the band from this release, glad I found them! 

* **R.A.P Ferreira - purple moonlight pages** - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/5fO3IS08lcTw9rfUtkgILv?si=uMcKQ16xRBe10VilBmB5Bg)

Oh man, what a great project from Rory Ferreira aka. Milo, Scallops Hotel, R.A.P Ferreira. This is my AOTY by far, an amazing album from my favourite rapsmith. Outstanding production from the great Kenny Segal, Aaron Carmack, Mike Parvizi and Rob Araujo. A word to describe this work: freedom. 

I lost the playcount for this LP.

* **Wake - Devouring Ruin** - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/0HPwpmR523VvXMFtnXPKT6?si=T6k2TFypRx-ufS3xASFc4A)

Awesome black metal album with highly technical passages.

* **Nicolas Jaar - Cenizas** - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/4uR6L8Gq7xozMSBpuxIQUp?si=LhBz7shlQWuvnXkLBm5DnQ)

Another exquisite release from one of the best. Minimal, delicate, and intriguing. Must listen. 

* **Oranssi Pazuzu - Mestarin Kynsi**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/0gsk1RGjMrtEDE05s0TZMf?si=wUrGYRP3T2eAIhh-SLY-gQ)

This is one of those bands that never cease to amaze me. They are on a league of their own tbh. They got even more adventurous when it came to introducing new sounds and textures.  Weird and amazing stuff.

* **Action Bronson - Lamb Over Rice**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/3BPX4x5EQOd9vzpPC2rMrm?si=kJSm749rQJWOhmEGKT_fjQ)

Really cool EP from AB and The Alchemist. If you like some East Coast falvored raps, great production and personality, look no further. 


* **Ka - Descendents of Cain**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/0yhyMBfxKhjy1f7TsXXssl?si=XGYR7KTnQdKM99Shhlwc7g)

Great concept driven album from rapper Ka. After his amazing collab with Animoss on Hermit and the Recluse, he comes back again with an awesome LP, which is not that consistent as Orpheus but nevertheless great.

* **Freddie Gibbs - Alfredo**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/3znl1qe13kyjQv7KcR685N?si=B_BWrl9uTF-mgN1bPJjb9A)

This album is gold from the cover till the last second. Great reference to one of my favorite pasta dishes, and The Alchemist ONCE AGAIN knocks it off the court.

* **Jeff Parker - Suite for Max Brown**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/2t6aF3BwIOKKQSpuHKGDAW?si=8GaCXu-wRoWCH5YqmniFPg)

This is a great sounding Jazz album. You transcend to another world.

* **Intronaut - Fluid Existential Inversions**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/2GKcaGXK7yLvmR9m5aEN5i?si=AXR5V-qMQOOkgccwKog3XA)

Prog metal giants Intronaut with another solid LP. At first listen, I didn't care that much for the album but then it grew on me. Awesome riffs, and overall composition.


* **Jessie Ware - What's your pleasure?**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/1CTm3ARqDETSm7GfvNYNJp?si=E8AU9fr-TxO1rBUkTTFapw)

Goddamn this is one of the best pop production I've heard in a long time, really adventurous. You'll dance on your chair.

* **Cryptic Shift - Visitations from Enceladus**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/7cGu80ia5OvMQlxIqTLMA1?si=6MSuGkBnSOO8jIfS6qjN6g)

Intricate, thrashy proggressive metal / tech death LP. Waiting for more releases from this band! 

* **Aminé - Limbo**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/6a8GwYiEMrXgMvZBvuBXrt?si=Z0DvSH6sTMS7r3b8VVCTCw)

Cool project from this talented rapper, many hip-hop tunes that can appeal to non hip-hop fans.

* **Dean Blunt - Roaches 2012-2019**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/6ghmAsmwVDGRF7hTllntgL?si=bU1m8VhQQw-7pN749FlaTQ)

Eclectic, hypnagogic, artsy, this compilation is a must listen!

* **Dan Beacon - Mistic Familiar**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/10e9Nf6QFZMTEy5TQm8G85?si=Y4YkbgMkRAGwkO5rCwAmvw)

Acclaimed album for 2020, great production, really fun progressive pop!

* **The Most - Of What We Have**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/1tnVhZQ91fPhzlXeQewyKr?si=GJKFIRDPSeudGd08GG2thg)

My introduction to this band, remarkable math rock tunes. It doesn't fall into the self indulgent nonesense that math rock bands can be prone to. Listen if you want a gentle introduction to the genre.

* **Anna Von Hausswolff - All Thoughts Fly**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/4ZsKcq417wTfTHtYzP7Sbf?si=-ynkwvbEQpWiq9pjbojGzA)

This can take you to very dark places, as only Anna Von Hausswolff can. A really inmersive and drony LP. I still remain more of a fan of Dead Magic, which is one of my favourite albums. This is an awesome project from an artist that constantly evolves.

* **Onehotrix Point Never - Magic Onehotrix Point Never**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/0oGzSazidykcL5XNTEuS9z?si=RPq-C5Z1S--vwVCh3gegAg)

Daniel Lopatin demonstrates once again that he is a musical genius, presenting more catchy, psychodelic and melodic songs that don't shy away from the progressive and experimental identity of OPN.

* **Yukika - Soul Lady**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/16yrp3d9pCJgQK2RMBTtd1?si=gxNKJCQkTeWp5UoUaL9fcA)

Korean City Pop, an awesome production that takes you back a couple decades. Fun and catchy, recommended if you want to approach Korean/Japanese pop.

* **Spectral Lore & Mare Cognitum - Wanderers: Astrology of the Nine**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/3d4OqJXfEcU8xA4JuIPFKW?si=_5r8b4f4RcaPPMc3lZxNqw)

Monumental atmospheric black metal release. A nearly 2 hour long journey though space, 

* **Neptunian Maximalism - Éons**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/0P25kH1ABGMaF9PzwZzFyc?si=3jRuXCG7RpKmMgMZr3vfCw)

This is why I love extreme music. A crazy avant-garde theater of sounds, incredible work.

* **АукцЫон - Мечты**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/4lTC5BWhhymRPkoAGRj7aw?si=17Fj-bTNSxOKfmxeyRAOOQ)

The latest release from this Russian Art/Folk-Rock based in St. Petersburg is a great compendium of songs. The production sounds really authentic and raw, this is one of things I love the most of АукцЫон, also helps that Russian is an awesome language.

* **Esoctrilihum - Eternity of Shaog**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/3XOHlh0kHUHKhXiMTgCMRK?si=ngFUJZqtTzS0r7ogX6OagQ)

My introduction to this French band. Really epic album with many highlights.

* **Four Tet - Sixteen Dreams**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/5gIa8hTQGPwVeNYjDwrraZ?si=FepveVWHTrKuV3CUGulKQg)

Not a groundbreaking release from Four Tet, but he's so good a producer man, every release is a great listen.

* **Run The Jewels - RTJ4**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/6cx4GVNs03Pu4ZczRnWiLd?si=q557UoU7Qd6ShEijalVzMg)

Banger after banger. One of the best MCs and additionaly one of the best producers in El-P(roducto). RTJ is one of the best things that happened to hip-hop.

* **Mike - WEIGHT OF THE WORLD**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/2kDlZYgWVfExQBqgjvlHpC?si=QKpIIbL1TCOMrl3SZpjlAg)

Really cool and introspective album. The production has interesting textures, a really recommended listen.

* **Dan Mason - Forever Nothing**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/5FF3m3nGdqeAA4s05dsHtb?si=2eUlrS5KR1iNR_nBCPdhKQ)

There's nothing remarkable about these release, but I listened to this album a lot. The chill vibe goes really well when working. Listen to Hypnagogia if you want a great intro to this artist.

* **Black Curse - Endless Wound**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/4ccRIggrRn3rn6OJJTtg19?si=EajbH_8BRX2K8ZEavuK4EQ)

This my favourite Metal album from 2020. Raw, noisy, aggressive, and filthy. Not a surprise since this band is associated with [Spectral Voice](https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/spectral-voice), whose Eroded Corridors of Unbeing LP is one of my favourite Death Doom Metal albums.

* **Fleet Foxes - Shore** - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/0lmjCPEcec2k6L7ysNIcd3?si=uF60aRHGQ26CC7AoG67gtg)

2020 release from one of my favourite bands, and new direction! A great change in production which sounds preety good and more accessible. Not too adventurous like Crack Up but great nonetheless.
