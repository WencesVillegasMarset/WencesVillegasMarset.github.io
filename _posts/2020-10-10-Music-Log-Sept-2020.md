So these are the albums that I listened to the most this past September, in no particular order.

Some are new releases, some are new discoveries and some are re-discoveries!

* **Klô Pelgag - Notre-Dame-des-Sept-Douleurs** - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/4kNpkRG2YpK4jV9OoopVNh?si=RrlIn6uOQF2Z9Vpo8LvuKA)

Really interesting art pop in french! Nice instrumentation, diverse sound palette.

* **Infinity Frequencies - Between Two Worlds** - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/03nyYzVw4m1cM2EG0vk6hP?si=MzxmEIyASUmK6xihW-VPVw)


This is music for staring blankly through the window. Hypnagogia, music for the quarantined, or by the quarantined?


* **death's dynamic shroud - DERELICT MEGATOWER I** - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/2pFPM7MWfnecHWWglJSYyh?si=jWflLBcKTpy6xyR5iA6eBg)

Well I had a couple of vaporwave days, and death's dynamic shroud had to appear. Almost all the discography is up on Spotify, amazing!


* **Kelly Lee Owens - Inner Song** - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/3DzlkHEQtb0ABoxze4Zxi7?si=4tV8IkArRm6V4PucqoXTDg)

Really nice house infused pop, great production. Sometimes it sounded to me like a Beach House meets Deep House, not a bad combo!


* **Vulkan - Mask of Air**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/2HRReKOFnpD5OcgvmMjDNM?si=2TJgBLgpTZWYY0YQW8-oNg)

Well crafted songs, quality production. I would like to say refreshing progressive metal, but I'll say solid. Their new 2020 release is really good as well, surprised that I hadn't discovered this band in my prog metal phase.


* **Aminé - Limbo**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/6a8GwYiEMrXgMvZBvuBXrt?si=eAfoVV6qQH69qDYXazpH-Q)

Fun album, this is the rap album you can recommend to your parents. Aminé knows how to craft interesting and accessible hip-hop. 


* **Cryptic Shift - Visitations from Enceladus**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/7cGu80ia5OvMQlxIqTLMA1?si=HP2TXXJbQ4uGh9fwwQAazA)

Intrincate and brutal, a really nice balance between the two. Really looking forward for more from this band. 


* **Anthony Naples - Fog FM**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/0XBtXweoCbA6MkNZ5F2NUW?si=uK6TcUz7RsqPsbifs6SuoQ)


Great production, quality deep house tunes.


* **Yukika - Soul Lady**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/16yrp3d9pCJgQK2RMBTtd1?si=Q4nFe97wQFStGYioJwWvmA)

This album man, so fun and colorful. Mixing classic city-pop vibes with the pristine and bright k-pop production style. This is a must if you want to get into quality korean music, which exists in great quantities!. 


* **Pleasure Model - Kendo Dynamics**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/3mMbZvCYOvjQ4jbUwYcjw5?si=7OM79SSSQlWVp03IquUwLQ)

This belongs to the great deep house albums catalog.


* **Primitive Man - Immersion**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/1z6E3dJeKCMLe5VeXHFzjM?si=kKSJOlzrTlOSxJRpeJCLtw)

Skull crushing music from one of the best Death Doom / Sludge Metal bands today. Another great album, more dissonnance than in previous releases.


* **Brian Eno - Another Green World (2004 remaster)**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/6uoeezh45SYEb8lcT8gDTY?si=zSB38PQrQVeqLZcu0xCB5A)

I mean, this is a classic. I can't begin to comprehend why while listening to the Eno catalog last year, I didn't realize the work of art that this album was. I have listened to this sound exhibition countless times for the last days. Mr. Eno demonstrates that he is an artist in all the sense of the word. Each sound in this album is in the perfect place. Fripp's snake guitar is sublime, you can visualize the textures and sounds in this LP. These albums make you love music.


* **Fleet Foxes - Shore** - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/0lmjCPEcec2k6L7ysNIcd3?si=vABmvHMnQjSWSrGj1ZouIg)

New release from one of my favourite bands, and new direction! At least a great change in production which sounds preety good. Not too adventurous like Crack Up but great nonetheless. 


* **Osees - Protean Threat**  - [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Spotify_Icon_RGB_Green.png" width="20" height="20">](https://open.spotify.com/album/16l3FJwjZooUHbU37sdeeI?si=HKcSGz5yTtSHmUcTSomW1w)

Well I like Thee Oh Sees more, but whatever, they are still the same awesome band. Great release, not a single bad track.
